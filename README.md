# IgorPro_All_in_Directory
A set of IgorPro procedures which run over all waves (whose name have a string followed by index ie. a number)

These procedures match a string against file name and iterate over the index ( a number) and do some operation on the waves. All waves 
matching the common string are thus processed quickly.
